# Jupyter Moodle plugin

This Moodle plugin integrates Jupyter Notebooks to offer a virtual programming environment.

The plugin connects to a JupyterHub server and authenticates the Moodle users on the JupyterHub Server. That way they
can access a Jupyter notebook from within Moodle.

Automated grading of Jupyter Notebooks is provided through [Otter-Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  
A quick introduction for writing assignments in the Otter-Grader format and a demo Notebook can be fond here:
